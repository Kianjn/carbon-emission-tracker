# Carbon Emission Tracker - Code Documentation

This document provides a detailed explanation of each Python script in the Carbon Emission Tracker project, including their purpose, implementation details, and the reasoning behind design decisions.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following Python files:
- `src/api_handler.py`: Handles API interactions for vehicle, flight, and electricity data
- `src/calculator.py`: Contains core calculation logic for emissions
- `src/web/app.py`: Flask web application server
- `src/__init__.py`: Package initialization file

## Detailed Documentation

### 1. API Handler (`src/api_handler.py`)

#### Purpose
The API handler manages all external API interactions for retrieving vehicle information and calculating emissions. It implements caching mechanisms to improve performance and provides robust error handling.

#### Key Components

##### Vehicle Data Management
```python
def get_vehicle_makes():
    """Fetches and caches vehicle manufacturer data."""
```
- Retrieves vehicle manufacturer data from the external API
- Implements caching to reduce API calls
- Handles API response validation and error cases
- Returns a structured list of vehicle makes with IDs and names

```python
def get_vehicle_models(make_id):
    """Fetches and caches vehicle models for a specific manufacturer."""
```
- Retrieves vehicle models for a specific manufacturer
- Implements per-manufacturer model caching
- Validates API responses and handles errors
- Returns a structured list of vehicle models with IDs and names

##### Emissions Calculations
```python
def get_vehicle_emissions(vehicle_model, distance):
    """Calculates vehicle emissions based on model and distance."""
```
- Calculates CO2 emissions for vehicle travel
- Uses vehicle-specific emission factors
- Handles unit conversions and data validation
- Returns calculated emissions in kg CO2

```python
def get_flight_emissions(departure, destination, passengers):
    """Calculates flight emissions based on airports and passenger count."""
```
- Calculates aviation-related CO2 emissions
- Validates airport codes
- Accounts for number of passengers
- Returns total flight emissions in kg CO2

```python
def get_electricity_emissions(country, consumption):
    """Calculates electricity-based emissions using country-specific factors."""
```
- Calculates emissions from electricity consumption
- Uses country-specific emission factors
- Validates input data and handles unit conversions
- Returns electricity-based emissions in kg CO2

### 2. Calculator (`src/calculator.py`)

#### Purpose
Contains core calculation logic and emission factors for different types of carbon emissions calculations.

#### Key Components

```python
def calculate_vehicle_emissions(vehicle_efficiency, distance):
    """Core calculation logic for vehicle emissions."""
```
- Implements the fundamental calculation formula for vehicle emissions
- Handles different efficiency units and conversions
- Provides standardized output in kg CO2

```python
def calculate_flight_emissions(distance, passengers):
    """Core calculation logic for flight emissions."""
```
- Implements aviation emission calculations
- Accounts for different flight phases (takeoff, cruise, landing)
- Scales emissions based on passenger count

```python
def calculate_electricity_emissions(consumption, country_factor):
    """Core calculation logic for electricity emissions."""
```
- Implements electricity consumption emissions calculations
- Uses country-specific emission factors
- Handles unit conversions and validation

### 3. Web Application (`src/web/app.py`)

#### Purpose
Implements the Flask web server that serves the frontend and handles API requests from the client.

#### Key Components

##### Route Handlers
```python
@app.route('/api/vehicle-makes')
def get_makes():
    """Endpoint for retrieving vehicle manufacturers."""
```
- Handles requests for vehicle manufacturer data
- Interfaces with the API handler
- Implements proper error handling and response formatting

```python
@app.route('/api/vehicle-models/<make_id>')
def get_models(make_id):
    """Endpoint for retrieving vehicle models."""
```
- Handles requests for vehicle model data
- Validates make ID and handles errors
- Returns properly formatted JSON responses

```python
@app.route('/api/calculate/<calculation_type>', methods=['POST'])
def calculate_emissions(calculation_type):
    """Endpoint for emissions calculations."""
```
- Handles all emission calculation requests
- Validates input data
- Routes requests to appropriate calculation functions
- Returns standardized JSON responses

##### Error Handling
- Implements comprehensive error handling for all routes
- Provides meaningful error messages
- Ensures proper HTTP status codes
- Handles edge cases and invalid inputs

##### Configuration
- Configures CORS settings
- Sets up logging
- Manages debug settings
- Handles environment-specific configurations
